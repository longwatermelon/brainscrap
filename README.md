Brainfuck in the form of a 2d game

# How to play
The `x` is you. On game start, x will be facing right by default. Control characters (`wasd`, `?`, `e`) are solid and must be in front of the player to be executed, while
brainfuck commands (`.,+-<>`) are not solid and are executed by stepping on them.

The x will first check the tile in front of it, then move.

# Control characters
* wasd: Gamer controls to move the x
* ?: Conditional operator, turn right if true else left
* e: Exit program

All original brainfuck characters are implemented except for `[` and `]`, because it's impossible to have closing and opening brackets on a 2d board.
